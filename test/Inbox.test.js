    The first argument in Contract() is the ABI. ABI is the
    interface between the solidity world and the javascript
    world. We do this by deserializing the interface object.

    Deploy() is the data required to be passed on to this 
    contract in order to create it. Two arguments are 
    required: the bytecode and the arguments for the
    constructor. 

    Send() instructs web3 to send out a transaction to create
    the contract. It requires the gasLimit and an external
    account. In this case, we use an account provided by 
    ganache.

    The returned variable `inbox` allows us to interact directly
    with the contract on the blockchain.
